Ok, #1 clan in the world when most of their players are very low SP. I get clan matchups, but this? Clans bust their asses to get into and stay in the top 10. This is a joke to those that actually Hello Reddit. The clan we are currently running is a very active clan and we are looking to expand. We currently have around 30+ members and we just created a Discord to communicate a little easier. The information for joining the clan is below if you are interested Name - Destroyers Members - 30/50 Discord - https://discord.gg/bVjjZyJ (https://discord.gg/bVjjZyJ) Required Trophies - 500+ We are currently accepting anyone so if you are a very active player and have less than 500 trophies. Join the clan SuperKingdom we want to get to 30 people to do clan war if u donate 30+ times u will be ranked I want know about clans trofs. How do you count the trophies in the clans. 
I've noticed mini-games in osrs are really dead. I was thinking maybe every week or so we have a "mini-game of the week" event. The mini-game of the week can give out cool/special prizes for that whole week. I'm not sure what the prizes can be, but i'm sure we can figure that out (Was thinking double exp but i know no one wants that). I just miss playing pvp games like Castle/Clan wars, and House parties. This can also be a way to bring back the completely dead games like Rat Pits or Burthrop. Hey everyone! The Clash Team is hard at work on the next update. More details regarding the update will be coming in the future, but before we start discussing what the core of the update will be, as we've done in the past, we wanted to share a growing list of QoL improvements that will be coming in the next update. As more QoL improvements are confirmed, this list will be added to. So keep an eye on this thread as we continue to make additional changes that will hopefully improve In Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, players could build their own FOBs and invade other players FOBs. A lite version of this feature would be insanely cool in Assassins Creed. So in Assassin‚Äôs Creed Japan imagine if you can fortify your own samurai house or more ideally castle. To successfully defend your castle you would have to allocate resources and upgrade your reinforcements, choose quantity and types of defenses (poison, fire, traps) as well as arm your assassin initiates NOTE: This discussion is about a 5v5 or a 6v6 competitive game mode. Casual players can still go play the existing game mode, and DMM can still exist. I don't really have the time to sit here for hours and make a list of suggestions or theorycraft a better solution for a competitive CW game mode, but I seriously don't understand why this hasn't attracted more attention. It's quite possibly one of the best and most objective-based game modes. Plenty of teamwork, insane mechanics. There is about 100,000 concurrent players at one time and there‚Äôs literally NOBODY at either of these mini games. For a free to play player these can be insanely fun especially clan wars. Two huge teams fighting it out seeing who can Eliminate the other team first. I don‚Äôt think people realize how fun these can be and it really does give you a break from the grind. The Castle is fudged by the True Sons and it just a marker on the map. We have how many people playing this game? Thousands and thousands? Why not create a donation pool of like 1billion steel and other material that can be donated by the player base and when its done can be built up to be this new epic BoO's with everything the white house has plus more. That's something i wish this game had. A way to expand on the world we are running around in. Would be cool to have an event where Thank you. Don't get me wrong, you're an ass. You didn't took anything, you just flew over my cliff constructed base because you could. It was barely a Tier 2, didn't even had rare stuff. But I don't hate you or your floating god. You taught me a lesson, showed me the weak points, the ones I haven't thought about. You and all the other guys that have raided me or killed me over and over again. Me, the naive friendly solo player on a PvP server that has the guts to leave a chest outside The clansmen were routing, they were losing, but Shagga saw his chance. The falcon lord was turned away from him and unaware of his presence and none of his metal suited horse riders were there to stop him. Shagga smiled a devilish and wicked grin to him self as he did his best to sneak across the battlefield, lowering his stance and readying his axe. Before long, he was close enough to reach the falcon lord with a swing of his axe, but no, Shagga didn't want just to kill him. The falcon
